## Some Tips

Many of these brushes were designed around a specific size. Most of them have some flexibility for increasing or decreasing the brush size. But if you resize them too much, they may start to look weird.

Some of the pencil brushes are set to the **[Compare Density]** blend by default. This is to partially reflect how pencil marks partially block further pencil marks from going on the page, and should make drawings look less messy.

However, certain styles of drawing and shading do require building up pencil marks on top of each other slowly. In this case, you may need to swich the brush blend mode to **[Normal]** or **[Multiply]**.
