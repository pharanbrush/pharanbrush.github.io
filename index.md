## PharanBrush

You can find my brushes at [my shop](https://ko-fi.com/pharanbrush/shop).

If you are having trouble with payments through the ko-fi shop, you can try the [PharanBrush gumroad store](https://pharan.gumroad.com) as an alternative.

### Getting Started

If you just want to jump in and get a feel for the brushes, each pack comes with a [Getting Started](getting-started) file to help you ease into the pack instead of immediately installing the hundreds of included brushes.  

Alternatively, each main zip file for each pack has an image comes with a folder of images that illustrate samples and tips for how to use the brushes.
