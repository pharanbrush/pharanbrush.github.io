## PharanBrush

You can find my brushes at [my shop](https://ko-fi.com/pharanbrush/shop).

If you are having trouble with payments through the ko-fi shop, you can try the [PharanBrush gumroad store](https://pharan.gumroad.com) as an alternative.

### Getting Started

Each of my brush packs have over a hundred brushes in them. Depending on how you want to proceed, I'm trying to provide more options to discover what brushes you might like or find useful, from swatches, videos, tips images and sampler sets.

Visit the [Getting Started](getting-started) page for more info.
