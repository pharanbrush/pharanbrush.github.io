(Exported with Clip Studio Paint 1.11.2)

### 2021 May 29

With the release of Clip Studio Paint 1.10.10, we finally have Dual Brush support. I've updloaded beta versions of what I'm planning to call the "Kropek" set. It is a separate file so make sure you download the Kropek file if you want to try it!

**Kropek** is similar to the Krupuk grainy markers, but automatically masked by some of my favorite Tzu brush shapes. This gets you a wet-media-dry-brush effect without having to mess around with mask layers.

## 2020
### 2020 Dec 18

The beta version of the **Shibe** layer setup and brush set has been added. This is a separate file. Download it if you want to try it out. **The Shibe setup can be a little slow at high resolutions.**

The brushes are adapted from existing brushes in the Tapioca and Krupuk sets.
